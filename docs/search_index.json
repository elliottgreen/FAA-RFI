Armavel has extensive experience in selecting, supplementing, and documenting security control baselines. Specifically, we have built expertise in identifying the appropriate security and privacy control baselines as outlined in NIST SP 800-53 &amp; NIST 800-53B. While working for VA Digital Transformation Center, our team accomplishments include 236 Information System evaluations for NIST 800-145 compliance 209 Information System evaluations for NIST 800-53 / 800-60 Security categorization 83 FedRAMP Initial Application Packages 66 FedRAMP Authorizations to Opperate granted 17 FedRAMP In Process designations Each of the information systems listed above required the expertise of our team to evaluate Low , Moderate , or High Impact systems. Baseline Number of Controls Sub Controls Privacy Baseline Controls 81 TBD Low Impact 131 TBD Moderate Impact 177 TBD High Impact 188 1207 Our team has engineered, implemented, and refined processes to maintain granular control while increasing throughput in Information System evaluation. The result of such control is the ability to create, adjust, and update documentation expediently. "],["security-controls.html", "Chapter 3 Security Controls 3.1 Starting Point Determination", " Chapter 3 Security Controls 3.1 Starting Point Determination Our team has mastered the precision required to select, tailor, and document Security Controls. NIST defined Security Controls are paramount to protecting an infomration system and the data it houses. To that end, we have dedicated resources to analyzing the Prioritization Codes and their subsequent sqequencing outlined in NIST SP 800-53, as well as CNSS Instruction 1253F for National Security systems. 3.1.1 Priority 1 Security Controls identified as Priority 1 form the foundational controls that lay the foundation upon which all other security controls are built. For this reason, our team has build an extensive porfolio of evaluative techniques for these (NaN) controls. 3.1.2 Priority 2 Security Controls identified as Priority 2 are built uopn the Priority 1 Secrity Controls. These (NaN) controls provide the foundation upon which the priority 3 Security Controls are built. 3.1.3 Priority 3 Security Controls within the Priority 3 category are built and implemented last. This allows for congruence between the dependant Security Controls and independant Security Controls.
