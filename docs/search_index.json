We have extensive experience in selecting, supplementing, and documenting security control baselines. Specifically, we are well veresed in identifying the appropriate security and privacy control baselines as outlined in NIST SP 800-53 &amp; NIST 800-53B.

To that end, we have dedicated resources to analyzing the Prioritization Codes and their subsequent sqequencing outlined in NIST SP 800-53. 3.1.1 Priority 1 Security Controls identified as Priority 1 form the foundational controls that lay the foundation upon which all other security controls are built. For this reason, our team has build an extensive porfolio of evaluative techniques for these (NaN) controls. 3.1.2 Priority 2 Security Controls identified as Priority 2 are built uopn the Priority 1 Secrity Controls.
